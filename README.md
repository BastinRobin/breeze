# Breeze [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scalanlp/breeze.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scalanlp/breeze)

Breeze is a library for numerical processing. It aims to be generic, clean, and powerful without sacrificing (much) efficiency.

The latest release is 1.1, which is cross-built against Scala 2.12 and 2.13.

## Documentation

* https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/wiki/Quickstart
* https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/wiki/Linear-Algebra-Cheat-Sheet
* [Scaladoc](http://www.scalanlp.org/api/breeze/) (Scaladoc is typically horribly out of date, and not a good way to learn Breeze.)
* There is also the [scala-breeze google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-breeze) for general questions and discussion.


## Using Breeze

### Building it yourself

This project can be built with SBT 1.2+

### SBT

For SBT, add these lines to your SBT project definition:

```scala
libraryDependencies  ++= Seq(
  // Last stable release
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze" % "1.1",
  
  // Native libraries are not included by default. add this if you want them
  // Native libraries greatly improve performance, but increase jar sizes. 
  // It also packages various blas implementations, which have licenses that may or may not
  // be compatible with the Apache License. No GPL code, as best I know.
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze-natives" % "1.1",
  
  // The visualization library is distributed separately as well.
  // It depends on LGPL code
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze-viz" % "1.1"
)


```

For more details on the optional `breeze-natives` module, please watch Sam Halliday's talk at Scala eXchange 2014 [High Performance Linear Algebra in Scala](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5849-high-performance-linear-algebra-in-scala) ([follow along with high-res slides](http://fommil.github.io/scalax14/#/)).


### Maven

Maven looks like this:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.scalanlp</groupId>
  <artifactId>breeze_2.13</artifactId>
  <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Other build tools
[http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scalanlp/breeze_2.12/1.1] (as an example) is a great resource for finding other configuration examples for other build tools.

See documentation (linked above!) for more information on using Breeze.


## History

Breeze is the merger of the ScalaNLP and Scalala projects, because one of the original maintainers is unable to continue development. The Scalala parts are largely rewritten.
